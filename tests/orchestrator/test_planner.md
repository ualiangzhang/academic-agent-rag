# Planner Tests

Scenarios:
- Role constraints: `user` role plan uses only allowed tools and within step caps.
- Budgets: planner sets budgets and respects max steps.
- Explainability: rubric contains scores and reasons for consistency, grounding, efficiency.
- Schema: steps include expected_evidence and params.
